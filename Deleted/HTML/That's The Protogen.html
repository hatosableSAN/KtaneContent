                <p>This module presents an ordered deck of cards. Select the one and only invalid card by pressing the
                    Protogen icon.</p>
                <p>Note that the invalid card will be invalid on the previous card, the card after it will be invalid on
                    it, and the card after will be <strong>valid</strong> on the previous card.</p>
                <p>The first card is always valid.</p>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>A card is valid if and only if all of the following conditions apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It has either the same rank or the same suit as the previous card.</li>
                    <li>When the number of cards played before it is even, one of the following three rules, chosen at random per module:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Its rank shares its even/oddness with the previous card.</li>
                            <li>It has neither the same rank nor the same suit as the previous card. (This overrides the first condition.)</li>
                            <li>Its suit is the same color as the previous card's.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When the number of cards played before it is odd, one of the following three rules, chosen at random per module:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Its rank does not share its even/oddness with the previous card.</li>
                            <li>It does not have both the same rank and the same suit as the previous card.</li>
                            <li>Its suit is not the same color as the previous card's.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
